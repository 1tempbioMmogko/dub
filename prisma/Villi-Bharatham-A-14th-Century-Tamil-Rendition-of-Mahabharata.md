# Villi Bharatham: A 14th Century Tamil Rendition of Mahabharata
 
Villi Bharatham is a Tamil epic poem based on the Sanskrit Mahabharata, written by Villiputhurar in the 14th century CE. It is considered one of the oldest and most complete versions of Mahabharata in Tamil. Villiputhurar was a Vaishnava poet from Saniyur, a village near Srivilliputhur. He was patronized by Varapathi, a local king who was fond of poetry contests. Villiputhurar composed Villi Bharatham as a challenge to other poets who could not match his skill and creativity.

Villi Bharatham follows the main story of Mahabharata, but with some variations and additions. It consists of 60 chapters, each containing 100 verses. The first 14 chapters deal with the genealogy and history of the Kuru and Pandava clans, the birth and childhood of the Pandavas and Kauravas, the education and marriage of the princes, and the events leading to the exile of the Pandavas. The next 18 chapters narrate the adventures and trials of the Pandavas during their exile, their encounter with various sages, gods, demons, and allies, and their preparation for war. The remaining 28 chapters describe the 18-day war between the Pandavas and Kauravas, the death and destruction of many heroes, the victory of righteousness over evil, and the aftermath of the war.
 
Villi Bharatham is notable for its poetic beauty, vivid imagery, dramatic dialogues, and moral teachings. It also contains many episodes that are not found in other versions of Mahabharata, such as the story of Nala and Damayanti, the story of Savitri and Satyavan, the story of Markandeya and Vishnu, and the story of Krishna and Rukmini. Villiputhurar also gives more prominence to some characters that are less prominent in other versions, such as Karna, Draupadi, Bhima, Duryodhana, and Krishna. He also portrays some characters differently from other versions, such as Yudhishthira, Arjuna, Drona, Bhisma, and Sakuni.
 
Villi Bharatham is a valuable source of Tamil culture, literature, religion, and history. It reflects the social and political conditions of medieval Tamil Nadu, as well as the influence of Vaishnavism on Tamil poetry. It also preserves many ancient Tamil words and expressions that are not found in modern Tamil. Villi Bharatham is widely read and admired by Tamil speakers across the world. It has been translated into many languages and adapted into various forms of art and media.
  
The following is a brief summary of the main events and characters of Villi Bharatham:
 
- The Kuru clan is ruled by King Santanu, who marries Ganga and Satyavati. He has two sons, Devavrata and Vicitravirya. Devavrata renounces his right to the throne and takes a vow of celibacy, becoming known as Bhisma. Vicitravirya marries Ambika and Ambalika, but dies without children. Satyavati asks her son from a previous union, Vyasa, to father children with the widows. Vyasa begets Dhritarashtra from Ambika, Pandu from Ambalika, and Vidura from a maid.
- Dhritarashtra is blind and cannot rule. Pandu becomes the king, but he is cursed to die if he engages in sexual intercourse. He marries Kunti and Madri, who have five sons by invoking various gods: Yudhishthira from Dharma, Bhima from Vayu, Arjuna from Indra, and Nakula and Sahadeva from the Ashvins. These are the Pandavas. Dhritarashtra marries Gandhari, who blindfolds herself to share his plight. She gives birth to a hundred sons and a daughter. These are the Kauravas. The eldest son is Duryodhana.
- Pandu dies in the forest after cohabiting with Madri, who immolates herself on his pyre. Kunti returns to Hastinapura with the five Pandavas. The Pandavas and Kauravas grow up together, but there is rivalry and animosity between them. Duryodhana tries to kill the Pandavas several times, but fails. The Pandavas excel in martial arts, education, and virtue. Arjuna wins the hand of Draupadi, the daughter of King Drupada, in a swayamvara. Draupadi becomes the common wife of all the five Pandavas.
- The Pandavas are given half of the kingdom, Khandavaprastha, which they transform into a prosperous city called Indraprastha. Yudhishthira performs the Rajasuya sacrifice and becomes the emperor of the world. Duryodhana becomes jealous and plots to overthrow him. He invites Yudhishthira to a game of dice, in which he cheats with the help of his uncle Sakuni. Yudhishthira loses everything: his kingdom, his wealth, his brothers, and his wife. Draupadi is humiliated and insulted by the Kauravas in the court. Bhisma, Drona, Kripa, Vidura, and Krishna try to intervene, but Dhritarashtra does not stop his sons.
- Krishna saves Draupadi from being disrobed by granting her endless garments. He also convinces Dhritarashtra to give back everything to the Pandavas on one condition: they have to go into exile for 12 years and live incognito for one year. If they are discovered in the 13th year, they have to repeat the exile. The Pandavas agree and leave for the forest.
- During their exile, the Pandavas face many hardships and dangers. They also meet many sages, gods, demons, and allies who help them or test them. They visit many holy places and learn many secrets and skills. They also acquire many divine weapons and gifts. In the 13th year, they disguise themselves as various people and live in the kingdom of Virata.
- Duryodhana suspects that the Pandavas are hiding in Virata and attacks it with a large army. The Pandavas reveal themselves and fight back. They defeat the Kauravas and their allies. The war also brings out the true identity of Karna, who is revealed to be the eldest son of Kunti and Surya. He was abandoned by Kunti at birth and raised by a charioteer couple. He becomes Duryodhana's best friend and sworn enemy of Arjuna.
- After completing their exile, the Pandavas ask for their kingdom back peacefully. Duryodhana refuses to give them even a needlepoint of land. Krishna tries to mediate between the two sides, 0f148eb4a0
